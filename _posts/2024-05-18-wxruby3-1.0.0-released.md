It's time! wxRuby3 has reached it's 1.0.0 stable release.

This release targets the wxWidgets 3.2.5 release by default, which contains (among many others) quite some fixes which 
came from the development of wxRuby3, and can be installed from [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/wxruby3) or 
downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/mcorino/wxRuby3/releases/download/v1.0.0/wxruby3-1.0.0.gem). 

This release is the result of about 1.5 years of development, starting at the abandoned remains of wxRuby2, taking a 
page out of the wxPython Phoenix book and ending with this release.

wxRuby3 is a cross-platform GUI library for Ruby, based on the mature wxWidgets GUI toolkit for C++. It uses native 
widgets wherever possible, providing the correct look, feel and behavior to GUI applications on Windows, OS X and 
Linux/GTK. wxRuby aims to provide a comprehensive solution to developing professional-standard desktop applications in 
Ruby.
wxRuby3 also provides extensive usage documentation at it's [Wiki](https://github.com/mcorino/wxRuby3/wiki) as well as 
a complete [API reference](https://mcorino.github.io/wxRuby3/index.html).
